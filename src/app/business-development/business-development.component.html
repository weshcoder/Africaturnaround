        We use two approaches to developing markets: 1) We link farmers to market by working with established market
        partners, mostly super aggregators and distributors and 2) We build capacity of SMEs to stimulate their role and
        strengthen the market system.

        We have a two level business development program; Kiota (Nest) and Stawi (Thrive).

            At this start up level, we adopt the entrepreneurial start up methodology that envisages 3 key stages of
            business growth and development: 1) Problem/Solution Fit, 2) Product/Market Fit and 3) Scale up Stage.
        </p> ​

        <p class="stage2">Kiota is focused on helping entrepreneurs build their businesses into a solution that
            customers want and to find
            a product/market fit so that they can get to the scale up stage. Once entrepreneurs have achieved the
            product/market fit breakthrough, they are ready for the scale up and are encouraged to sign up for the STAWI
            program to learn what they need and how to raise capital to enable them drive their business to scale.</p>

            Stawi (Thrive) is a 6 - 12 month training and coaching program targeted to growth oriented SMEs playing as
            key market system drivers. The generic edition is focused on helping the SMEs achieve two key goals: 1)
            Sales and Market growth and 2) Raising capital to finance growth and scale. Stawi has a non-generic edition
            that is customized to the level and needs of different SMEs.

        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 9.5vw; font-weight: 400; padding-bottom: 40px">The program is focused on a business
            growth plan with 6 key outputs:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> A refined model, using the Business Model Canvas;</li>
            <li> Sales and marketing plan;</li>
            <li> Financial statements (P & L, Balance sheet and asset register and Cash flow)</li>
            <li> An investor proposition in the form of a short and punchy pitch deck with summary financials;</li>
            <li> How to present investor propositions in a way that focuses on the investor perspective of the
                opportunity; and</li>
            <li> Investor types, needs and expectations and how to find an investor match.</li>
        </ol>

        <p style="margin-left: 9.5vw; padding-top: 20px; font-weight: 400; padding-bottom: 40px">Why we do not recommend
            the typical business plan at this level:
        </p>

        <p style=" max-width: 80vw; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 30px;">
            We are cognizant of the fact that majority of SMEs fail in their attempt to raise capital largely because
            they fail to meet investor needs and expectations. The value of investing 100 to 200 hours in writing a
            business plan is for instance increasingly being questioned as investors are placing less emphasis on the
            business plan. They are unlikely to read a business plan at the outset.

        </p>

        <p style=" max-width: 80vw; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 30px;">
            However, they will listen and react to a pitch. It is therefore more important to develop a short, punchy
            power point presentation that provides answers to the key questions that an investor will want to know about
            the business. Investors who may need more information are likely to ask for it to be included in the pitch
            deck other than embarking on a business plan development exercise.

        </p>
        <p style=" max-width: 80vw; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 30px;">
            Additionally, typical investor propositions give too much emphasis to financials – business angels take a
            fairly cynical view of finances, believing that, in the words of one investor, “accountants … can tweak the
            assumptions and come up with any figure. So it's the last thing I look at." Investors will not look at the
            financials if the narrative doesn’t interest them. Accordingly, an investor readiness program which focuses
            just on these elements is unlikely to be successful.
