    It is difficult to build vibrant and stable market systems without vibrant
    and stable supply chains. We believe that vibrant and stable smallholder
    supply chains can only be realized by building entrepreneurial farmer
    organizations that are run as professional businesses. The Shirika program
    is a world-class localized program that was designed to do exactly that! The
    program is offered in partnership with SCOPEInsight and IFC.

  <p class="special">
    The ALP program (Shirika is our localized edition) follows this AMEA
    framework for professionalizing farmer organizations:

    Africa Turnaround Limited is a licensed implementer of the SCOPE assessment
    methodology and an approved implementer of IFC's Agribusiness Leadership
    Program (ALP). The program comprises of 4 key components: 1) Assessment, 2)
    Training, 3) Coaching, and 4) Linkages. We already have a pool of trained
    and certified SCOPE assessors and have been involved in undertaking SCOPE
    assessments and designing and executing SCOPE aligned capacity building
    interventions for some of the biggest organizations in the region.
  </p>

  <p class="special">
    The program takes a 5 step process:
  </p>

  <p class="special">
    Step 1: Conduct assessments
  </p>
  <p>
    Our SCOPE trained and certified assessors conduct baseline assessments of
    POs using the SCOPE methodology. In parallel, we carry out a training needs
    assessment (TNA) by talking to the client, POs, smallholders, and others in
    the value chain. Determine their goals and needs.
  </p>
  <p class="special">
    Step 2: Create a strategy for the client
  </p>
  <p>
    We then use TNA and baseline results to create a capacity building strategy.
    Provide training and coaching recommendations for POs and define how to
    build the capacity of local professionals to deliver the program.
  </p>
  <p class="special">
    Step 3: Build + deliver the program
  </p>
  <p>
    We then build a customized training and coaching program that responds to
    TNA and assessment results. Our IFC trained trainers conduct the training.
    Trainers walk into the classroom with detailed knowledge of the
    participantâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. The participants create a
    development plan that address performance gaps identified during the
    assessment. After the training, the organization is paired with a trained
    coach who supports the leaders as they complete their development plan and
    identify opportunities to apply what they learned during training.
  </p>
  <p class="special">
    Step 4: Conduct reassessments
  </p>
  <p>
    After training and coaching, the assessors conduct reassessments of POs
    using the same SCOPE tools as in Step 1. Compare baseline and reassessment
    scores to measure program effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p class="special">
    Step 5: Create market linkages
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we facilitate market linkages for POs that raise their assessment
    scores. POs finish ALP with everything they need to create a business plan
    and achieve commercial results, such as financing and new business.
